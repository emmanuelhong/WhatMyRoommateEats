            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p> I'm Emmanuel and this is a food blog about my the food my roommate, 
                Brendan Vu eats or cooks. I first met Brendan at Northeastern University 
                in our first year. Although we were basically random roommates at first, 
                we found out that we only lived 15 minutes away from each other back home.
                From that point on, I slowly got to know him and his appreciation for food and 
                his wonderful appetite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we don't have the best untensils and materials for cooking,
                having a kitchen is more than enough for our second year. It was
                something Brendan really missed out on during our freshman year.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we see here on the left, we have pesto pasta that Brendan made himself. 
                With a friends blender, he was able to make pesto with the basil leaves he bought.
                This website is to document what he makes and eats out
                just for fun and memories and I wanted to share that with you all. There will be many changes to 
                the website as time goes on so stay put!
