            <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Hong and I created this blog as an assignment for class and to experiment HTML and CSS. I am currently a student at Northeastern University studying Business and Design. In the business side of things I am learning MIS and FinTech. On the design side of things, I am studying interaction design. I thought making this blog would be good practice and good fun and I plan on continuing to update this website to show progress in my skills. I am excited to see what this website becomes and how much it will transform over the next few years!
