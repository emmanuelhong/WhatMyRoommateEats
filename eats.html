                <br> pork
                <br> yum! 
            </p>
            <p> Made during our planning of our Friendsgiving happeing this Friday! We are gonna have a lot to post on that day!
                We will not be eating turkey this year because chicken is better. My roommate plans on cooking a lot for this friday but the one item both of us is really looking forward to is the buffalo chicken bread. The buffalo chicken bread is something that will probably be up here in a few days.
